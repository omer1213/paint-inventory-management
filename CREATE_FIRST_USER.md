# How to Create Your First User

Since sign-up is disabled for security, you need to create your user account through the Clerk Dashboard:

## Steps to Create User:

1. **Go to Clerk Dashboard**
   - Visit: https://dashboard.clerk.com/
   - Log in to your Clerk account

2. **Navigate to Users**
   - Click on **"Users"** in the left sidebar
   - Click the **"+ Create user"** button

3. **Enter User Details**
   - **Email**: Enter your email address
   - **Password**: Create a strong password
   - **First Name** (optional): Your first name
   - **Last Name** (optional): Your last name

4. **Save the User**
   - Click **"Create"**
   - Your user account is now created!

5. **Sign In to Your App**
   - Go to: http://localhost:3000
   - You'll be redirected to the sign-in page
   - Use the email and password you just created
   - You're in! 🎉

## Adding More Users (If Needed Later)

If you need to add more authorized users in the future:
- Follow the same steps above
- Each user must be created through the Clerk Dashboard
- No one can self-register through the app
